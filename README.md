Restarting FRC in 2023

The software on the Windows machine was lost, so we had to start from scratch to get a firmware image for the robotRIO and resurrect the FRC robot built by Team 426.

## Get the required programs

Following the recommendation from SOURCE we fist installed the following programs on our Windows machines:

- program a
- program b - with link
- program c do create the image
- VS Coide to edit Java files

## Creating the firmware image

This took quite some time, even on our i7

## Configuring the firmware

The motors on the CAN bus need to be addressed. But how? Can we give them individual names (configure the Talon SRX)

## Connect the Joystick controller to the Windows machine and drive the robot over Wifi

We'll see about that.
